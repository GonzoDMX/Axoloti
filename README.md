# Axoloti

This is a fork of the discontinued Axoloti project by Johannes Taelman - johannes.taelman@gmail.com

I have forked this to keep the codebase alive should the original go offline. I have also made a few bug fixes so that patches compile without errors on modern Linux systems.

Axoloti is a platform for sketching music-DSP algorithms running on standalone hardware.
