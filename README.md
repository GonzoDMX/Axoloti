# Axoloti

Axoloti is a platform for sketching music-DSP algorithms running on standalone hardware.

This is a fork of the discontinued Axoloti project by Johannes Taelman - johannes.taelman@gmail.com
This fork is to keep the codebase alive should the original go offline. I have also made a few bug fixes so that patches compile without errors on modern Linux systems.

### Why not push these bug fixes to the original repo?
Well, the original repo has moved on to the incomplete version 2.0. I have decided to fork V1 as it is the most stable version of the software and thus the easiest (for me) to maintain. I do not have the time to finish version 2.0 from where Johannes left off. I do have enough time to maintain a 1.0 version so that I can continue to use my Axoloti Core.

### Warning
I'm only interested in using this software with Linux. So bug fixes are only tested on linux and may break functionality on Windows or Mac.
